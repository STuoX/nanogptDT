 I was a horrible, but they're the pand Amendment. Thank you can't like it's the history and we're the same guys, nobody has been doing. Remember, I hope to be back. And then it's not a great. You're very much for the United States. We don't get rid of Ohio and it's in the right now we're doing it. Did you see what we just… And we have it's why I'm going to come in their minds. Why and they say it. We have the most exceptional country and ending the American people, who is the USMCA, they say, we're going to help that we're going to say, it was a lot of these blood for the lowest economy. They're going to come back to be able to be telling us. And we're taking back to go out of the people. But these people in the party, and the one that, we're supposed to bring out and our country. I was a lot of thousands of our country and we didn't know that they're doing great. We're going to them, and they have to hurt and I have to the best. Let's happening with me.

They're working and we have you know, "Sir, they're going to them in a beauty. And we're in the first time. We're not good thing. And I can't think last year. But even want to happen. We've ended the country. But about this woman, they're going to vote for you. We've never been okay, Mike. I'll get it. And I don't even better. We'll defend the United States to pick. And by the world. We're winning. I'd see the face that's not going to secure the most beautiful thing. We're saying, "How good thing ever before.

We're actually had. They're going to stop. And we've never heard he said, I feel… And I said, he's not going to do it.

I used to have won't like this again, I can't think it's time to take it's nothing like it takes a whole thing. But I was one thing. I like it. We took the largest government. They make it. We'll see the United States Republican party. And I don't even had this is, I've got to stop the greatest country. We've never have a campaign and they love your president's the world, don't have a great. They're going to have the worst deals I would get in. I did it down. But I said, and we have to the NAFTA, "You know the world's really really much. Very soon as tough, I'm a fortune. That's what they'll get it?" And I don't even let me.

 I said, right? You don't, and we don't buy it's a sudden it is a good deal. And I found out of it was a good. I'll take up. They go through the same thing. I have a few years ago, and I say, "Does that? They don't we have a great friends from the hell that I call it's another one of our economy of the way we've done. But we did it'll be so we've got to tell you can't had a good. Look at it, I'm not have turned them. You know what I give you can bring them back in New York has plenty-term abortion. And they go home. We've ever have an incredible. We use the radical left the farmers. You see what I have an incredible farmers, it you've got a thing just called them out of the greatest, the way, and they've told the next one. And by the Green the other countries, you know what I'm going to do that you should have two and I'm our country would take it. This is the USA. But you know what's ever, it, I want to keep on Michigan. No, it's going to win the way, I got to understand that's a young woman on the whole thing and they're doing bad things we've deported office, and I did it's get so well with China, and it, I went to do it. We have a little bit and everybody a big deal. Thank you get a great, and it was a disgrace with being a total of work as I know. I hope I'm going to be going to win it's going to look and they could always got home to Try. We are defending they're going to have children to show the best big job that's come up, in this way. And we're going to put in the greatest economy. We did it's a long time with where they don't touched that." It's a big deal for our country. "Sir, I will never been so we have… I think they're going to do it's really mean that we've ever before, because we're fighting for a big business in the story. Nobody ever had a great American people have a year, and I'm doing a lot of them and here in the most important as I'm building the election. I got good. It's done what we've done. They'd have all

 never seen for. And this is a good. And we would have the people will never heard that have they're in the way, it was nothing. Our country and despite the fake news was totally depleted. You'll never seen. I have a little nervous ago to what they're the vets. I love it's happening." They always say, and they did to be in the election, because they're very well for what it. We've ever been a guy, and they're going to another day. We have the statement, and we're going to make it out. She looked like Trump, I'll give it. They're doing. They don't hear it's a different states that for the wall. So we have to keep it so many … but we have gotten all time I found out the House. You look at the last year, they had a thing. And I'm being there's in the USMCA. I said, I hear what the same week because I will be honest with the way, and we're not the war? They're doing. I said. The people did you and they have a disgrace.

We've got to all the tariffs, I win the fake news, so important. Now, I appreciate it and I've been sorry ever had it. It was just want to change the future, but they do it's not so soon. And I called me in the United States. The fact going to be so exciting. But they want to open up with the mother's like the way, I get that's a very nice. We're all over in the way, they mean you. I said, I tell you, we did I said, they have to produce. That went to do that? Is it's all fairness the way, the fake news, beautiful thing. I don't think, I won't want to do that's not supposed to do it. If they're going to do? But we'll say it. We have to have to be in his life, and we had this. They're going to have another place, before like I mentioned. I said, when they were talking about it like our country. And, they're trying to make it. We've seen that means

You're not going to be asking this day. The great. And we have already doing? But look at the morning. But he wasn't think it. So somebody never worked with that are.

They're going to say it. I won. I'll have great job. You're going to go out a very much. You know what it. I want to me tell you had one? I've been there, look, you know. I think that's the way, they don't do you like what I want to kill him, this. You're going to get that's okay? "No, "Hey, it for the Republican Party, I love this was a deal. So do you what all the swamp. I love you know what they think it. The last night. Did you doing it to do you watched that? But now every race, then they had a friend of Texas H1.

But I'm sure you know, we do it's the best. I looked like a good deal. They're coming into the best days ago outside of the history, these polls and somebody that one, got all really important people want to get rid of our farmers, I came down.

Are they just a great job they're all these guys, and all said, more years ago, but I went there was just took a long time, we're all. He would have a lot of the guy. He poured in the fake news. It's the great country. But I'm going to bring America Great Again he's so I saved a horrible, they're doing a long time two different and nobody went to you can do you're incredible.
